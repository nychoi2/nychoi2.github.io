	<h3> More About Me: </h3>

	<p style="font-size: 20px"> I am currently planning to major in Information Science and Psychology with a certificate in Art Studio. I enjoy spending time with family and friends. I have two cats who help me with my art endeavors. I love to travel and learn about different cultures which inspire my art. My favorite mediums are charcoal, oil pastel and acrylic paint. In addition to drawing and painting, I dabble in photography and post my images on my <a href="https://vsco.co/nadi-choi/gallery">VSCO</a> page.</p>
