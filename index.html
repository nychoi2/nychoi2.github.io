Welcome to my blog! The goal of this website is to share my passion for art with the world. My history as an art student goes back as far as I remember. As a child I loved all kinds of drawing and craft activities. I loved taking art classes at the local art-center, making collages, and creating drawings for friends, family, and teachers. My facination with art continued into high school where I indulged in various drawing classes and eventually became president of my school's art club. Now at the University of Wisconsin-Madison I am taking my first art class in college and hope to receive an <a href="https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/education/art/art-studio-certificate">art studio certificate</a>. This website is a creative way for me to practice coding in HTML/CSS and share my art journey with others.</p>
